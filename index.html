		<p> The little girl in this photo is my cousin's daughter, Sienna. Sienna, 5, is a kindergartener who I believe represents growing up in a modern American family. </p>
		<p> Her father, Ali, moved to California for work and will be there for the next year - maybe two. Because of how temporary it is, Sienna, her mother and brother all moved to Brooklyn to live with Ali's parents. Shereen, Sienna's mom, works full time in the city and goes to school to finish her degree on the weekends. Her little brother Adam stays at home with his grandmother while Sienna is at school and Shereen is at work. </p>
