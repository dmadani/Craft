		<p> I spent my winter vacation almost entirely with two kids: Sienna, 5, and Adam, 3. They're my cousin Ali's kids and they moved back to Brooklyn with their mother when Ali got a temporary job in California. </p>
		<p> The kids spend the entire day at their grandmother's, since their mom, Shereen, has a nine to five job in Manhattan. My aunt does her best, but her grandkids are usually confined to their bedroom - no trips to the park and no running around. </p>
		<p> I thought spending my weekdays their would be easy for me, since I get to hang out and get free food and play with the kids. What I didn't realize was how much me spending time there would mean for the kids. </p>
		<p> Every afternoon I would help Sienna with her kindergarten homework. After that, she, Adam and I would all play in the room together. We played Sleeping Beauty, racecars, hide-and-seek, Ghost and tons of other little make-believe games. My aunt would run her errands and I'd play Kidz Bop so we'd all dance together. Every time I opened the door to my aunt's apartment I would be greeted with excitement and every night I left we'd usually have some crying fits from  Adam. </p>
		<p> Sienna and Adam are pretty representative of the modern family. Daycare is too expensive, so grandma looks after them. Both their parents work, so quality time is regulated to nights, weekends and holidays. Grandma is great, but she doesn't play and doesn't do homework. The kids are so lucky, they have a huge family of people who love them. But it's so different from how I grew up, surrounded by cousins and playtime and a stay-at-home mom. So I spent my winter break learning about the new family, while also getting free food. </p>
